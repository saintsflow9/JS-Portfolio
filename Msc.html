								<h3>PROJECT<br/></h3>										

									<p>The purpose of the study was to test the feasibility of using <a href="Aerial View.html">aerial</a> and field surveys to detect surface blind enthalpy energy systems.
										It is hypothesised that these blind enthalpy systems underground would release an influx of CO2, of which the abundance of CO2 introduced into the system, 
										is absorbed into the roots of the overlying vegetation (grass, bushes etc.). 
										This accelerates plant growth through photosynthesis which would be detected in remote and field surveying with higher <a href="Images/NDVI.JPG">NDVI values</a>, 
										CO2 fluxes and soil temperature.

										<h3>OBJECTIVE<br/></h3>	

										<p>Ultimately the point is to use remote sensing to more accurately detect smaller geothermal resources that could be developed on a smaller scale. 
										Eventually this would hypothetically reduce the cost of resource exploration and increase energy development.<br/></p>
									
										
										<h3>WORK<br/></h3>	

										<p>My role in this research project was to design a system where the methods (of data collection) could be developed and optimized for time and accuracy.
											The methods of data collection went through multiple rounds of reiteration based on my judgement of efficiency. 
											With initial help from the technicians, I did all the <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/43%C2%B031'17.1%22S+172%C2%B034'33.0%22E/@-43.5214033,172.5755722,405m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m13!1m6!3m5!1s0x6d318bf03a01d3eb:0x15f68e4b5b9214c2!2sIlam+Fields!8m2!3d-43.5216412!4d172.5749152!3m5!1s0x0:0x0!7e2!8m2!3d-43.5214129!4d172.5758267?hl=en">preparatory </a> 
											work myself (image below), the system needed to be easily understood, by the team that I would later lead in Harihari. <br/></p>

										<p>The <a href="field1.html">Study site</a> (image below) is <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/43%C2%B017'29.1%22S+170%C2%B024'47.4%22E/@-43.2926549,170.4123302,913m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m14!1m7!3m6!1s0x6d2947d39c70455f:0x500ef8684797430!2sHarihari!3b1!8m2!3d-43.1482215!4d170.5515074!3m5!1s0x0:0x0!7e2!8m2!3d-43.2914046!4d170.4131726">located</a> 
											on the West Coast of New Zealand. This area is situated on a <a href="Images/TP.JPG">tectonic plate boundary</a> where there are many active geothermal systems that we can observe.</p>
																					
											<a class="image fit"> <img src="Images/ss.JPG" alt=""/></a>

										<p>We used <a href="uav1.mp4">UAVs</a> equipped with <A HREF="Images/DJIA.JPG">multispectral</a>  and <a href="Images/DJIZ.JPG">thermal</a> cameras. Multispectral IR imaging 
											provided valuable information on plant health using the NDVI. The field survey used the <a href="Images/M3.5.JPG">Trimble R8 GNSS system</a> 
											to record <a href="Images/RAWD.JPG">each sampled ground point</a> where I used the <a href="Images/LiCOR 820.JPG">LI-820 CO2 Gas Analyzer</a>  with <a href="Images/ST.JPG">soil temperature probes (20cm & 50cm long).</a></p>
									   
											
												

										<p>My team also included a student who became interested in what I was doing after over hearing a conversation that I had, which ultimately ended with him joining my team. 
											I agreed that I would teach him my methods (for his upcoming MSc. Project) and in return he assisted me in recording the field data, learning in the process. 
											This student went on to complete <a href="Images/DC.jpg">his masters in GIS.</a><br/></p>

										<h3>END RESULT</h3>	

										
									
										
										
										<p>The results suggested that in Harihari the interaction between subsurface hydrothermal fluids and the overlying soil and vegetation could be
											detected using the methods outlined above.

										<br/>
										
										<p>The Image (below) showed elevated levels of CO2 flux, soil temperature at both 20 and 50cm deep at the swamp and cliff edge. 
											Cliff edge is situated above a known geothermal area and the swamp is a theorised to be  product of subsurface geothermal activity.
										<a href="Images/HND.JPG">NDVI</a> was relatively high, but exhibited a lot of 'noise' with significant reductions in alternative surface types (not soil or grass).
										
										

										The results also showed elevated <a href="Images/STH.JPG">surface temperature</a>  
										values however the sample size is too small to draw any meaningful conclusions.</p>
										
										<a class="image fit"> <img src="Images/H1.JPG" alt="" /></a><br/><br/>

										<p>The results ultimately suggest that the hydrothermal soil interaction could be detected in Harihari. To see more of the backend work such as
											my python code, kriging, graphs, tables etc. that I used to develop the model and complete
											the calculations, check my out thesis from pages 59 (47) onwards</p>

										<h3>REFLECTION</h3>	
																			
										<br/>
										<p>Completing this thesis project forced me get comfortable with many different scientific disciplines: geology, 
										electromagnetic physics, electrical engineering, biology, chemistry, environmental science, computer science and geographic information science.
										I enjoyed researching the relevant topics.
										<br/><br/>
										I strengthened my skills all areas but the three areas that stand out was leadership, programming and problem solving.  
										While I grew as an analytical researcher I also learned that despite how hard I tried I could not control everything.  
										There will always be set backs and learning how continue making progress was paramount. 
										<br/>
										<br/>
									
										The experience gained here was extremely valuable and I am excited to tackle the next project head on.
